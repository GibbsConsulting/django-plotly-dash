FAQ
===

* What environment versions are supported?

At least v3.5 of Python, and v2.0 of Django, are needed.

* Is a ``virtualenv`` mandatory?

No, but it is strongly recommended for any Python work.

* What about Windows?

The python package should work anywhere that Python does. Related applications, such as Redis, have their
own requirements but are accessed using standard network protocols.

* How do I report a bug or other issue?

Create a `github issue <https://github.com/GibbsConsulting/django-plotly-dash/issues>`_. See :ref:`bug reporting <bug-reporting>` for details
on what makes a good bug report.
