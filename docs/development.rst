Bug reports and other issues
----------------------------

The ideal bug report is a pull request containing the addition of a failing test exhibiting the problem
to the test suite. However, this rarely happens in practice!

The essential requirement of a bug report is that it contains enough information to characterise the issue, and ideally
also provides some way of replicating it.
